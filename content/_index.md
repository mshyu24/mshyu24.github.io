# Welcome!

### Learn more about me and my multitude of interests!

I built this site to act as a repository of information ("It's *not* just a resume site, Milo!)
about me, and to give myself something to do during my COVID-19-related research hiatus.

Find some of my favorite recipes, read about my current doings, or get in touch
with me -- I encourage you to explore.
