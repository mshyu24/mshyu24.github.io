# Hi! I'm Maiya Yu.

I am a current senior (class of 2021) at the University of Michigan College of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, where I am majoring in biochemistry and pure
mathematics, and minoring in computer science. I am also an undergraduate
researcher in the [Tall lab](https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/tall-lab/) in
 the Department of Pharmacology. I tutor -- both privately and in
 the [Math Lab](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/course-resources/math-lab.html),
 and in the winter, I am an MWrite Fellow for Chem 216 with the Sweetland Writing
 Center and [Prof. Shultz](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/shultz-lab/).

I currently serve as the Executive Director of the [University of Michigan
Science Olympiad](https://umichscioly.org). We host middle and high school students on our campus for
our annual Invitational tournament. I spent two years on Board as Human
Resources before transitioning to the role for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021
seasons. I was involved with Science Olympiad in middle school and high school
and I love giving back to the organization that inspired my scientific aspirations
 whenever possible. I was an Event Supervisor for Water Quality B&C for the 2019
Region 10 Tournament, and Event Supervisor for Write It Do It Division B for the
 2019 State tournament and planned to supervise for the 2020 tournament before its cancellation.

I am also on leadership with InterVarsity Multi-Ethnic at the University of
 Michigan. We are committed to building and maintaining an intentionally
 multi-denominational and multi-ethnic faith community on campus.

 Outside of my assorted University of Michigan affiliations, I am an avid folder
of paper -- I helped with the University of Michigan Museum of Art Family Art
Studio in June 2020 to guide people through a virtual exploration of origami!
I am also a loving bird mother to Chico, my beloved pet Pacific Parrotlet, and
a rabbit aunt to Toast and Goat. I am a passionate coffee aficionado and amateur
barista -- I am always looking to improve my latte art skills and perfect my
Chemex pouring. I am a frequent baker and dinner party host, and enjoy doting
over my beloved Sourdoughra, a 3:4 water:flour-fed sourdough starter. I love
creating and I am an amateur photographer, watercolorist, embroiderer, crocheter,
and all-around creative dilettante.
