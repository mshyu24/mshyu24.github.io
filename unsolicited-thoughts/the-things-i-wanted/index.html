<p>As I write this, I have just finished up my last year of my undergraduate
education, and a huge part of that this year was applying to graduate school.
An important thing to know about me is that I am a planner &ndash; I like to know what I am getting myself into, and my favorite way to procrastinate is worrying about things that I don&rsquo;t need to worry about yet. What this means is that for the first
three years of undergraduate, I procrastinated by spending absurd amounts of time reading about getting into graduate school.</p>
<p>Now admittedly, I did the same thing during high school: for three years, I procrastinated by reading about and thinking about getting into college.
What inevitably happened when I reached the point of actually applying to college (and then to graduate school), is that I immediately felt like I knew nothing.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time reading about how to win fellowships, secure good letters of recommendation, how to make a good impression during interviews, how to write strong statements of purpose &ndash; you name it, I read it.
I even read my way through all of Nature&rsquo;s Career archives, and then through all of Science&rsquo;s Career archives. I exhausted every page of Google results, read hundreds of blog posts and articles &ndash; and I still had questions and felt frustrated.</p>
<p>The advice felt too general, too broad, things felt too opaque. So when it came time to actually do anything, I felt like all of my endless reading had been mostly for nothing.</p>
<p>So of course, now that I&rsquo;m on the other side, I think I&rsquo;ll take a shot at writing the advice that I was trying so desperately to find, and maybe one day it&rsquo;ll help someone.</p>
